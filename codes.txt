CODES:
1.Creating an Apex Class(ConsumerRecord)

public class ConsumerRecord {
    
    public static void sendEmailNotification(List<consumer__c> consumers) {
        List<Messaging.SingleEmailMessage> emails = new List<Messaging.SingleEmailMessage>();
        
        for(consumer__c consumer : consumers) {
            if(consumer.Email__c != null) {
                Messaging.SingleEmailMessage email = new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage();
                
                // Set the email recipient
                email.setToAddresses(new List<String>{consumer.Email__c});
                
                // Set the subject of the email
                email.setSubject('Welcome to Our Company');
                
                // Build the email body
                String body = 'Dear ' + consumer.Name + ',\n\n' + 
                              'Welcome to MY RICE! You have been identified as a valuable customer to us. ' + 
                              'Please continue your journey with us, as we strive to provide you with high-quality resources.\n\n' + 
                              'We are proud to associate with valuable customers like you and look forward to offering you exciting discounts and product offers.\n\n' + 
                              'So why hold back? Take a leap of faith and shop with us more, while we continue to provide valuable products and offers.\n\n' + 
                              'Thank you for your purchase!\n\n' + 
                              'Here are some products that other customers, who purchased similar products, also bought.\n\n';
                
                // Set the email body
                email.setPlainTextBody(body);
                
                // Add the email to the list
                emails.add(email);
            }
        }
        
        // Send all emails
        if (!emails.isEmpty()) {
            Messaging.sendEmail(emails);
        }
    }
}

2.Creating an Apex Trigger:

trigger consumer on consumer__c (after insert) {
    if (Trigger.isAfter && Trigger.isInsert) {
        ConsumerRecord.sendEmailNotification(Trigger.new);
    }
}
